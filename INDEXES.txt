INDEXES
--------------------------------------------------------
when you perform a query
-If you have no index,the database checks every document
--> called a collection scan
--> Not efficient

An index provides an organized way to look up data by storing a subset of the data with pointers to the
location of the records.

-If you have an index, the database checks the index
--> if query can be answered with an index, it's called a covered query
--> More efficient queries and updates 

When should you create an index?
- When you frequently query on the same fields
- When you frequently perform range-based queries on fields

But Indexed have costs!
Indexes need to be maintained 
- each index adds about 10% write overhead
It's trade-off-faster read vs. slower writes

When the queries are the most common query patterns
When you have enough RAM to fit the index



Type of indexes:
Single field indexes
Partial indexes
Compound indexes
multikey indexes
Text indexes
wildcard indexes
Geospatial indexes
Hashed indexes
